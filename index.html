            <p>
                I am doing software development and design since 2004.
                From that time, I have done many different projects,
                worked with many briliant teams
                and played with many different technologies, programming languages and frameworks.
                I never stopped to play with the code, no metter played I the team lead role or tech lead role.
                I am alwasy interesting about how the thechnologies work, what is thier limitations if any and so on.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                In 2013 I joined <a href="https://www.iponweb.com" target="_blank">IPONWEB</a> company as a Software developer. Since that time I had a chance to
                work in many different teams and played many different roles. That is an exiting jorney I have in this company.
                Here I started to understand that it is not an easy to change the job when you sarounded by many
                talented people. I see how people come and go, however the talented people cannot leave IPONWEB the stay, that is an amzing fact.
                I also started to understand that the team could be not just people you work in one project, but also the team is the people you
                work accross the company. This is incredible feeling!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                At the moment, I played a role of "hands-on" technologist in our deparment.
                That role includes the following list of activities
                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                    <li>a lot of communication inside our business unit with almost every team-member</li>
                    <li>communication with the teams from other business units</li>
                    <li>design of the CI/CD pipeline for all the services in our buisiness unit and some services from another BU</li>
                    <li>desing of the integrations with our parners</li>
                    <li>create technical specifications when we need to make a decision with many stakehliders</li>
                    <li>design of the automations which helps our team to run the processes efficiently</li>
                    <li>design, implement and own of the SLO/SLI framework</li>
                    <li>do the SRE activities</li>
                </ul>
                To manage all those activities and have a time for myself and for my family I use several unique technincs and I would like to share
                those techinics with the people.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Breafly, all the technics follow the following algorithm:

                            <strong>TBD</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working in Trading infrastructure, we are designing CI Pipeline for the comprehensive testing of
                            the high-performance <a href="load-balancer">load balancer</a> written on GOlang.
                            We mainly focus on the performance and the stability of the product.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To meet those reqiurements we created next stages:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Race condition detector</li>
                                <li>Core dump detector</li>
                                <li>Performance degradation detector</li>
                                <li>Resource degradation detector(cpu, heap, runtime in our case)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That helped us significantly improve the time of delivery
                            and the quality of the product.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm in the team which is doing an Intelligent Load Balancer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That smart server is able to keep more than 1.5K requests per one core per second.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here we focus on the performance tasks and doing hard work to bring new features and
                            keep performance at least at the same level as it is on the previous version.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We are also building CI/CD pipeline which allows us to keep development velocity, high quality, and delivery speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's build over Jenkins CI and includes some interesting and non-standard stages like "profiles comparison" among the standard tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here we're following the "Configuration as a code" approach
                            and also do not couple the main functionality with the Jenkins Groovy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That allow us to use same configuration across all the host machines. Which is very convenient.
                        </p>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another focus of our team is so called "Performance-Playground" component.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That is set of the configurations which are orchestrated by Terraform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That allows us to set up a dev mini-cluster with the prod environment
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            and replay the any slice of the live traffic through the development branch; collect profiles, metrics and compare them with the prod values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides that, we are working with the other teams to insert the load balancer in their existing testing frameworks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main challenge here is that current framework is a mature project with the huge codebase. Much complex logic has already built over that framework and many more tests are written. The task is to migrate all without affecting the current processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It sounds like "It's just a proxy server, you only need to change the system ports". Sounds good, but there are some nuances :)

                            When maintaince of monolith becomes too hard it's time to go
                            to microservices architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We started breaking our monolith into microservices and
                            as a result
                            we designed API Gateway with authZ inside it
                            and
                            several services behind the gate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All that infrastrucute was protected by the CI pipeline,
                            which was able to startup the whole infrastructure
                            and run the tests agains it as well as to focus only on one
                            particular service and play with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started to like mSOA,
                            when some time later I was able completely rewrite
                            one service. That work was done fast and without any dependency
                            to the rest of the system.

                        <h5><a href="#"><strong>Rest API</strong></a></h5>
                        <p>
                            We created a monolith application server which
                            was designed the same way as a "LEGO" constructor.
                            That means that it has a lot(I mean <b>a lot</b>)of small components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our primary focus was on the possibility of the system
                            to configure itself on the fly by given configuration.
                            That configuration driven development allows us to
                            manage objects and thier relations with OpenAPI compatible schemas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The schema was the hart of the system. <i class="fa fa-hart"></i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such an approach helps us
                            <ul>
                                <li>speedup the projects delivery</li>
                                <li>keep all souce code in one repository</li>
                                <li>support many projects by small team</li>
                            </ul>
                            That was a "rocket scince" system.
                            Our team becomes an experts in Python, Django and DRF.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also build a CI pipeline which
                            allowed us to keep high quality of the delivered projects.

                        <h5><a href="#"><strong>Social network</strong></a></h5>
                        <p>
                            That was fun!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've created a social network for the pets and their owners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was time of social networks,
                            it appeared one by one, I think, every month.
                            Our MVP had a standard set of features:
                            <ul>
                                <li>News feed</li>
                                <li>Gallary</li>
                                <li>Account management</li>
                                <li>Messaging</li>
                                <li>Community</li>
                                <li>Posts management</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That time I did the full-stack and actually
                            was impresed how cool things you can do with JavaScript(that time I use jQuery and Bootstap).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="padding-top:20px">
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <div class="project-item">
                <div class="mshogin-project-hover">
                    
                    <div class="inside">
                        <h5><a href="#"><strong>Email marketing Service</strong></a></h5>
                        <p>
                            That was all about emailing.
                            We sent around 30-40 millions of emails every day
                            and every email was personalized.
                            I think the most challanged tasks were:
                            the <strong>Mail sender</strong>
                            and the <strong>Targeting machine</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final version of Mail sender
                            was written on Perl programming language
                            and was based on event loop programming approach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was time of "hardcore": daemons,
                            multiprocessing communications,
                            sockets, synchronizations and all that stuff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Targeting machine was my first experience with AdTech.
                            We did personalized targeting for each letter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, we came up with the solution which allowed
                            us to check all possible variants and get the result with O(1).
                            Basicaly, we created the complext data structure with custom hashing function.
                            When ads were ready, we generetead AdCache,
                            that was really huge, but worked super fast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the way, doing that project I learned <strong>TDD</strong>
                            and since that time
                            I do testing for all my code everytime.
                            Actually, that was time when many current technologies were born:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>jQuery</strong> was wolking around the world
                                    and ajax was like a magic
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Hudson</strong>,
                                    these days we call it <strong>Jenkins</strong>,
                                    made automation an easy task
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The <strong>Django framework</strong> made making web
                                    an easy task
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Python</strong> was beating
                                    <strong>Perl</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Node</strong> showed that
                                    <strong>JavaScript</strong> is cool for backend
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Golang</strong> showed how it's easy to make
                                    background processes and orginize communication
                                    channel between them.
                                </li>
                                <li>and many more...</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Actually, I am happy that I participated that technology revolution, and still participating.
